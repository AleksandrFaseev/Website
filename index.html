            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week we learned about engineering safety.
            i learned how to open and write codes in aws.
            I was taught how to wtite commands in cloud9
            learned how to copy and edit code
            every week i will learn new commands and codes
            we played on outsaid in ball <br>

        8/28-9/1 Week 2 <br>
        we did some work on this.
        We modeled our projects and did designs.
        We did work on the theme.
        We watched videos and took notes.
        Most of all i liked doing my design <br>

        9/5-9/8 week 3 <br>
        My team and i did a project in the application.
        We came up with a drawing and design that we added to the diagram in the application.
        We started to create it live and proceeded to the initial stage-this is a bridge for the car.
        Next we will do another part of the design - the ball falling on the car.
        After three lessons we will have a finished project. <br>

        9/11-9/14 week 4 <br>
        we finished our project.
        The concept was that we launch a car that drives with a needle in front and crashes into a ball,which bursts after touching it.
        We did this work for a week and finished with the planned idea.
        We have a small but working design.
        I really enjoyed doing this

        9/18-9/22 week 5 <br>
        this week we did a few things.
        we made homemade ships with extra weight and put it in the water to test the reliability of the ship.
        Also we drew a large letter E on paper.
        After this we exchanged papers with a partner.
        After the exchanged we had to redraw the letter E according to specified dimensions and cut.
        Also we did workshhet and video notes.

       9/25-9/29 week 6 <br>
       This week we analyzed the system processor into groups.
       We had to disassemble and put all the parts back together.
       After that we checked the system processor connected it to the monitor.
       In another lesson we colored a picture with parts of a computer.
       At the end of the week we wrote a teson this topic.

      10/2-10/6 week 7 <br>
      This week we did several projects.
      We watched a video about prosthetics and then made them ourselves from paper.
      The task was to make it move.
      Next in the application we made a prosthesis for an animal.
      I made a prosthesis for a lion.
      
      
     <p></p>
     10/9-10/13 week 8
     In this week we found new people for the team.
     We wrote a test on a new topic.
     Today we did a project in the application.
     I made a rocket and designed its design.
     I like doing this project.

     10/16-10/20 Week 9
     This week we did some work.
