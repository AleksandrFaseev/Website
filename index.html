        we did some work on this.
        We modeled our projects and did designs.
        We did work on the theme.
        We watched videos and took notes.
        Most of all i liked doing my design <br>

        9/5-9/8 week 3 <br>
        My team and i did a project in the application.
        We came up with a drawing and design that we added to the diagram in the application.
        We started to create it live and proceeded to the initial stage-this is a bridge for the car.
        Next we will do another part of the design - the ball falling on the car.
        After three lessons we will have a finished project. <br>
