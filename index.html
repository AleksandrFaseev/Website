            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week we learned about engineering safety.
            i learned how to open and write codes in aws.
            I was taught how to wtite commands in cloud9
            learned how to copy and edit code
            every week i will learn new commands and codes
            we played on outsaid in ball <br>

        8/28-9/1 Week 2 <br>
        we did some work on this.
        We modeled our projects and did designs.
        We did work on the theme.
        We watched videos and took notes.
        Most of all i liked doing my design <br>

        9/5-9/8 week 3 <br>
        My team and i did a project in the application.
        We came up with a drawing and design that we added to the diagram in the application.
        We started to create it live and proceeded to the initial stage-this is a bridge for the car.
        Next we will do another part of the design - the ball falling on the car.
        After three lessons we will have a finished project. <br>

        <p>
        9/11-9/14 week 4 <br>
        we finished our project.
        The concept was that we launch a car that drives with a needle in front and crashes into a ball,which bursts after touching it.
        We did this work for a week and finished with the planned idea.
        We have a small but working design.
        I really enjoyed doing this

        9/18-9/22 week 5 <br>
        this week we did a few things.
        we made homemade ships with extra weight and put it in the water to test the reliability of the ship.
        Also we drew a large letter E on paper.
        After this we exchanged papers with a partner.
        After the exchanged we had to redraw the letter E according to specified dimensions and cut.
        Also we did workshhet and video notes.

       9/25-9/29 week 6 <br>
       This week we analyzed the system processor into groups.
       We had to disassemble and put all the parts back together.
       After that we checked the system processor connected it to the monitor.
       In another lesson we colored a picture with parts of a computer.
       At the end of the week we wrote a teson this topic.
        
      <P></P>
      10/2-10/6 week 7 <br>
      This week we did several projects.
      We watched a video about prosthetics and then made them ourselves from paper.
      The task was to make it move.
      Next in the application we made a prosthesis for an animal.
      I made a prosthesis for a lion.
      
      
     <p></p>
     10/9-10/13 week 8
     In this week we found new people for the team.
     We wrote a test on a new topic.
     Today we did a project in the application.
     I made a rocket and designed its design.
     I like doing this project.
     
     
     <p></p>
     10/16-10/20 Week 9
     This week we did some work.
     First we made a homemade rocket.
     We made it from a bottle,cardboard and other things.
     After work we launched our rocket outside.
     With the help of water and gas she flew.
     
     
     <P></P>
     10/23-10/27 Week 10
     This week i did an experiment.
     My partner and I did an experiment with a bottle and dirty water that should have become clean.
     We put cotton wool and poured water into it,which seeped through the cotton wool.
     The water gradually became lighter.
     We also wrote a test on the previous topic.
     
     <p></p>
     10/30-11/3 Week 11
     This week we studied a new topic.
     We studied about electric engineering.
     We did laboratoty work in the tinkercard application.
     It was necessary to connect the details of the circuit and for it all to work.
     And also wrote work on worksheets.

       11/6-11/10 Week 12
       This week we did laboratory work.
       We took the diagram and connected the parts to it.
       We also worked in the application and designed a virtual circuit.
       We wrote code in an application on a computer that gave a signal to the circuit.
       We managed to mae several light combinations.

                1/8-1/12 S2Week1
                This week we did a detalied story about our bridge project.
                There was an 8th questions and an additional picturies.
                We also did work with starch and water.
                The result was an unusual effect.
                When you touch hard its hard and when you touch it softly its soft.
                
                <p></p>

                We started preparing for a new project.
                Associated with a mousetrap on wheels.
                We have certain parts and their quanity.
                We will work on the project for a month and at the end we will get our mousetrap.
                We will also make a project in the application Tikencard.

                1/22-1/26
                We started doing our project in Tikencard.
                
                Did  the worksheet on the mousetrap and made the calculations.
                
                Measured objects and drew a drawing.
                
                Discussed with our partner the furter actions of our project.
                
                Read additional information about mousetrap.
