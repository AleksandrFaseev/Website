            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week we learned about engineering safety.
            i learned how to open and write codes in aws.
            I was taught how to wtite commands in cloud9
            learned how to copy and edit code
            every week i will learn new commands and codes
            we played on outsaid in ball <br>

        8/28-9/1 Week 2 <br>
        we did some work on this.
        We modeled our projects and did designs.
        We did work on the theme.
        We watched videos and took notes.
        Most of all i liked doing my design <br>

        9/5-9/8 week 3 <br>
        My team and i did a project in the application.
        We came up with a drawing and design that we added to the diagram in the application.
        We started to create it live and proceeded to the initial stage-this is a bridge for the car.
        Next we will do another part of the design - the ball falling on the car.
        After three lessons we will have a finished project. <br>

        <p>
        9/11-9/14 week 4 <br>
        we finished our project.
        The concept was that we launch a car that drives with a needle in front and crashes into a ball,which bursts after touching it.
        We did this work for a week and finished with the planned idea.
        We have a small but working design.
        I really enjoyed doing this

        9/18-9/22 week 5 <br>
        this week we did a few things.
        we made homemade ships with extra weight and put it in the water to test the reliability of the ship.
        Also we drew a large letter E on paper.
        After this we exchanged papers with a partner.
        After the exchanged we had to redraw the letter E according to specified dimensions and cut.
        Also we did workshhet and video notes.

       9/25-9/29 week 6 <br>
       This week we analyzed the system processor into groups.
       We had to disassemble and put all the parts back together.
       After that we checked the system processor connected it to the monitor.
       In another lesson we colored a picture with parts of a computer.
       At the end of the week we wrote a teson this topic.
        
      <P></P>
      10/2-10/6 week 7 <br>
      This week we did several projects.
      We watched a video about prosthetics and then made them ourselves from paper.
      The task was to make it move.
      Next in the application we made a prosthesis for an animal.
      I made a prosthesis for a lion.
      
      
     <p></p>
     10/9-10/13 week 8
     In this week we found new people for the team.

                1/8-1/12 S2Week1
                This week we did a detalied story about our bridge project.
                There was an 8th questions and an additional picturies.
                We also did work with starch and water.
                The result was an unusual effect.
                When you touch hard its hard and when you touch it softly its soft.

                1/15-1/19 S2Week2
                We started preparing for a new project.
                Associated with a mousetrap on wheels.
                We have certain parts and their quanity.
                We will work on the project for a month and at the end we will get our mousetrap.
                We will also make a project in the application Tikencard.

                1/22-1/26 S2Week3.
                We started doing our project in Tikencard.
                
                Did  the worksheet on the mousetrap and made the calculations.
                
                Measured objects and drew a drawing.
                
                Discussed with our partner the furter actions of our project.
                
                Read additional information about mousetrap.

                1/29-2/2 S2Week4 
                We drew drawings for our mousetrap car.
                
                Then we made the dimensions and started making it.
                
                The base was made of cardboard,the weels were rims.
                
                On top there was a mousetrap with the help oh which our car moved.
                
                We are almost finished our car,but the detail still needs to be finalized.

                2/5-2/9 S2Week5
                We redesigned the design with wheels.
                The axle was made according to our drawing and the wheels were glued even stronger.
                The distance also depends on the base and wheels,so in the second project we improved this.
                Our distance was about 68 feet
                All that remains is to coplete the design with the mousetrap and the end.

                2/12-2/19 S2Week6
                We improved our second building.
                
                We completely remade the second option.
                Made the axle even tighter,improved the cardboard base,
                attached a mousetrap.
                We also made the axes strighr so that the mousetrap would not roll 
                to the right and left.
                Also thought about the distance between the wheels for better results.
                On the second construction we did better than on the first.
                Made a larger base suitable for a stick connectiong the weel and the 
                mousetrap.
                Made a more accurate calculations and set a mousetrap,
                Our drawback was related to the wheels,we made them freer.
                Also attached the axle more tightly.
                
                Percent error-12.

                Last week we finished making our project.
                
                We secured our parts in the mousetrap and were ready for test.
                
                On the test we launched our mousetrap and it went very well.
                
                Its drove more than two meters.
                
                Im happy with the result and the project.

                2/26-3/1              S2Week8 
                we started making a new project using egg.
                The task is to ensure that the egg does not break after falling.
                From possible materials i want to make a ball on which a bowl with an egg 
                is suspended.
                I think my cirrcuit is working and will withstand in intact.
                Last week i already made a bowl where the egg will be surrounded
                by soft material.
                
                About wheels and doors
                I considered everything where it was written and where
                there handles and hings.
                This includes...
                *Lockers
                *Chromebooks
                *Seats in the auditorium

                 3/4-3/8   S2Week9
                 I countinued to do my project.
                 I finished ma bowl,made the bottom tightly,also stuffed the bottom and
                 the wall tightly with cotton so that the egg was tightly compressed
                 between the soft cotton.
                 Attached the parachute package to the sticks and tubes.
                 We also made a mini project-a paper airplane.
                 I made it very smooth for long distance.

                  3/26-3/29 S2Week11
                  We started making a new boat project.
                  
                  The point is to build a boat that can sail a certain distance 
                  on water.
                  
                  For me it will be light materials-a bottle,a glass,sticks.
                  
                  The bottle will be the base and there will be cups on the sides 
                  to balance the boat.
                  I think i will sacceed because it is easy project.
                  
                  <img src="boat.png" width="200px" heigh="200">

                  4/1-4/5 S2Week12
                  So,i finished my boat.
                  
                  We started testing it and unfortunately it floated a short distance.
                  
                  I think i needed to make the bottom heavier so that it would foat with the 
                  flow of water.
                  
                  I realized that my design was slippery and easy for the water,so it just
                  rolled over a short distance.
                  
                  Probably if i had more time i would have realized my mistake and completed it to perfection.

                  4/8-4/12 S2Week13
                  We started designing a new project.
                  
                  It is connected to a big boat that will float in our school
                  swimming pool.
                  
                  I made the first design in Tikencard.
                  
                  We also did a challenge with Post-It stickers.
                  
                  It was necessary to make a bridge and the longer the better.

                  4/15-4/19 S2Week14
                  So we have already started making our boat.
                  
                  Came up with a drawing and plan for our project.
                   
                  We really need to make it vety carefully and thoughtfully so that it 
                  doesnt drowmn in the test 
                  
                  We need about 10 sheets of cardboard for our trick and one roll of tape.
                  
                  We will be doing this for a month so i think we will have time.

                   We have a clear plan for our boat that we will make.
                   
                   We have completly come up with the design so that our boat does not skin.
                   
                   Two girls from my team will sit there to cheak the boat,because they are lighter.
                   
                   We also did mathematical calculations V.
                   
                   We we'll finish it by the end of the month.
